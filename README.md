## Problem 1: Basic Image Processing

- **M-file name:** `HW1_826453843.m`

### Task 1: Image Loading and Display

In this task, we read and displayed the image "Waterfall.jpg" using MATLAB from the 'Requirements/' directory.

### Task 2: Display RGB Bands

We displayed each color band (red, green, and blue) of the image separately to visualize its components.

### Task 3: Convert to YCbCr Color Space

The image was converted into the YCbCr color space, which is commonly used in image and video compression.

### Task 4: Display YCbCr Bands

We displayed each band separately, including the Y (luma), Cb (chroma blue), and Cr (chroma red) components after the conversion.

### Task 5: Subsample Cb and Cr Bands

In this task, we subsampled the Cb and Cr chroma bands using a 4:2:0 ratio and displayed both subsampled bands.

### Task 6: Upsample Cb and Cr Bands

The previously subsampled Cb and Cr bands were upsampled using row and column replication and displayed for examination.

### Task 7 and 8: Image Conversion and Display

We converted the image back to the RGB format and displayed both the original and reconstructed images.

### Task 9: Visual Quality Assessment

Task 9 invited visual assessment of the reconstructed images, allowing for qualitative evaluation and comments on visual quality.

### Task 10: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

We calculated the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and reconstructed images to quantitatively assess the reconstruction quality.

### Task 11: Compression Ratio

In this task, we calculated and discussed the compression ratio achieved by subsampling the Cb and Cr components using the 4:2:0 approach.

## Results

The results of these tasks, including the calculated MSE value and compression ratio, can be found in the code and comments within the associated MATLAB file.

## Conclusion

This homework assignment provided practical experience with fundamental image processing tasks and assessment techniques. Please refer to the code comments and results within the MATLAB file for detailed information about each task.
